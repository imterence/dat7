Problem here is that all hours for both visits have already been issued to the J105P WO and the PO auto closed when filled up with hours. Meaning I do not have a PO to issue from if I make a new J105 WO.
If I make a new PO to issue hours from  it will also be a mess since the invoices from both Halvorsen & Siemens will only be pointed at the SPS POs. I am in contact with Joy Marie Del Rosario  to see if she can assist. If not I suggest Igoris make an internal invoice against J105.
